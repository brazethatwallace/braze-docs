## Connected Content calls with abort and retry logic

If a Connected Content call uses abort logic for the same condition as the retry logic, the abort logic takes precedence. This prevents any retries from being attempted. Retry logic already resends the call before aborting it if the status code is unsuccessful. Because both target the same status code behavior, you can remove the abort logic and the call still aborts if all retries fail.
