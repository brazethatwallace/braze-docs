Welcome to Braze Docs!
===


[Releases](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-docs/releases) · [Deployments](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-docs/deployments)

This repository contains the source files for [Braze Docs](http://www.braze.com/docs), which hosts all user, developer, partner, and API documentation for the Braze customer engagement platform.

If you'd like to help improve the docs, you can:

- [Submit a request](https://www.braze.com/docs/request) or ask in [#ask-docs](https://braze.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C0D10FTGQ) on Slack
- [Contribute](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) (see [docs/contributing/README.md](docs/contributing/README.md) for the full handbook)

## Quick start

> [!TIP]
> For a full walkthrough, see [Contributing to Braze Docs](docs/contributing/README.md).

To build the docs locally, you'll need Ruby version `3.3.0` installed. In the terminal, open `braze-docs` and check for Ruby version `3.3.0`.

```bash
cd ~/braze-docs
ruby --version
```

If this version isn't installed, use a [supported version manager](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#managers) to install it. For example, using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv):

```bash
rbenv install 3.3.0
```

If you have multiple versions of Node.js installed, use `asdf` for version management.

```bash
brew install asdf
```

Next, install project dependencies.

```bash
bundle install && asdf install
```

To start your local docs server on localhost `http://127.0.0.1:5006`, run the following command. To stop your server, reopen the terminal and press <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.

```bash
# for 'en' language:
rake

# for other languages:
rake de
rake es
rake fr
rake ja
rake ko
rake pt_br

# Partner hub tiles (Sanity) fetch automatically when `partner_api: true` in `_config.yml`.
# To skip that network call (offline / faster builds): PARTNER_API=false rake

# to render content in '{% markdown_embed %}' tags (e.g. Developer Guide changelogs):
MARKDOWN_API=true rake
```

> [!NOTE]
> Prepending `MARKDOWN_API=true` to your rake command lets you preview content within a `{% markdown_embed %}` tag, such as the content on the [Developer Guide: Changelogs](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/changelogs/) page. Technology [Partners](https://www.braze.com/docs/partners/home/) hub tiles load from Sanity whenever `partner_api` is enabled in `_config.yml` (the default). Use `PARTNER_API=false` if you need to skip that network request locally.

### Faster local builds

Jekyll spends a lot of I/O copying static assets (for example images under `assets/`). For day-to-day work you can:

- **Serve:** `rake` already uses `--incremental` and `_incremental_config.yml` (`keep_files` for `assets`). Restarting the server no longer deletes `.jekyll-metadata` by default, so incremental state is preserved. Run `JEKYLL_CLEAN=1 rake` when you need a full clean rebuild.
- **One-off build:** `bundle exec rake docs_en:build_fast` (English) or `bundle exec rake "lang:build_fast[fr]"` (other locales). Alternatively, `JEKYLL_FAST=1 bundle exec rake docs_en:build` enables the same merged config and `--incremental` for the standard build task.

## About `bdocs` wrapper

[`bdocs`](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-docs/blob/develop/bdocs) is a wrapper script located in the root of this repository that helps you replace links, generate redirect URLs, create deployment descriptions, and more. For an in-depth walkthrough, see [`bdocs` wrapper](docs/contributing/bdocs.md). To get started quickly, run the following command to see a list of available commands:

```terminal
./bdocs
```
